VUE Challenge:


Build a travel destination builder SPA using Vue.


You will build a website focused around a tool which lists all the countries in the world and lets you add them to a list of countries that you want to travel to.


Use this public api as your source of countries:


https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-all


The site navigation should contain:


·
Countries


·
My List (only show if there are items in the list)




Countries - Index page


Show a list of countries  (10 at a time with pagination)


Search by name (using api)


Show name of country and region only by default


On clicking a country show the extra attributes for that country - region, subregion, flag, lat and long.


Each country has an add to list button. If clicked it adds the country to your list (store)




List page


Display your listed countries (store)


Have a button to remove (from store)
